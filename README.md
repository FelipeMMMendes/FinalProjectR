# FinalProjectR
Repository for my final project in the Introduction to R for Data Science discipline.

Hello there guys!

In this project, we will be analysing the ''Spotify and Youtube'' dataset from Kaggle, using R.

It's a database that contains various informations about songs published in the Spotify and Youtube platforms. 

Link for the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salvatorerastelli/spotify-and-youtube;

It was created by an user named Salvatore Rastelli, with two other collaborators, Marco Guarisco and Marco Sallustio. I tried researching about them, but i didn't find anything.

This dataset uses the Youtube and Spotify API's to collect the data, and it was last updated in March of 2023.
